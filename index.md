## The Proposal - A minimalist’s choice for Christmas food

A minimalist’s choice for Christmas food is algorithm / application helps you find a Christmas recipes according to what ingredient you have.


### Thinking behind
There are a lot of recipe help you to cook the food you want, while you have to go and purchase the right amount of ingredients. And after cooking, you might have some ingredients left and they usually will "sleep" in your refrigerator forever. The proposal of an algorithm / application is to help you try a minimalist way. Don't waste the ingredients and make your food according to what ingredient you have.


### Dataset
For this hackathon, we are able to find open data on Kaggle. It is a dataset of recipes with ingredients in exact amount for Christmas occasion.

### Further Application with more data
We can adapt the algorithm later if we have recipes for other occasions available. 
For example: Gym occasion recipes, a weekly recipe set, seasonal food, customized recipes based on ingredients you grow at home, etc.
